# dsqr-dotdev

https://dsqr.dev source is currently here, https://github.com/dsqr-dev/website. This is a monorepo that holds all packages, apps, etc. The library is a new custom implementation, designed as an alternative to React for the web part and everything else to setup and run on homelab (i.e. Nix). Currently in development - will formalize the implementation when complete.
